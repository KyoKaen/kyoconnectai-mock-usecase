  <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>KyoConnectAI</strong> is an early-stage AI startup building <strong>customizable AI chatbot agents</strong> for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that lack technical infrastructure and AI expertise. We help SMBs—starting with campsites, leisure parks, and event organizers—automate repetitive customer inquiries (FAQs) and streamline service operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built on advanced AI models such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google GenAI and Mistral, our chatbot offers multilingual support, 24/7 availability, and plug-and-play integration via Google Cloud. We’ve already deployed our MVP for a camping site, validated interest from multiple sectors, and are working to convert early demos into paid pilot customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our business model is based on a high-margin subscription SaaS structure, with pricing starting from €100/month. With 8,000+ campsites in France alone, even modest penetration results in strong recurring revenue potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    KyoConnectAI is now seeking a business-savvy co-founder to lead growth, outreach, and strategic development alongside our technical founder.
